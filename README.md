# kubernetes fluentd
Collects logs from your nodejs application, assumed you use winston like [this](https://github.com/waleedsamy/hello-world-expressjs-docker) project.

#### How it works
It parse logs generated by your nodejs application (using winston), these logs exist in `/var/log/containers/*`, which is managed by kubernetes.

your log message will look like `{"log":"message","stream":"stdout","time":"2016-10-04T11:31:02.492951101Z"}`. but `log` entry must have a json object, otherwise it will be ignored by current fluentd configuration.

#### Notes
* Elasticsearch Host and port are configured with environment variables `ELASTICSEARCH_HOST` and `ELASTICSEARCH_PORT`, and both have a default value `elasticsearch` and `9200` respectively.
* Fluentd configuration is based on [gcp-fluentd](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/tree/master/cluster/addons/fluentd-gcp/fluentd-gcp-image) and [fabric8io/docker-fluentd-kubernetes](https://hub.docker.com/r/fabric8/fluentd-kubernetes)
* Fluentd exclude kubernetes logs which start with `kube` or `k8s`
* json_in_string parser is based on [fluentd-elasticsearch-container](https://github.com/oosidat/fluentd-elasticsearch-container/blob/master/plugins/json_in_string.rb)
